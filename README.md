## Running *SportChef*

### Using Docker

First, you have to create a network where all the running *SportChef* container instances can communicate with each other. You only need to do this once:

`docker network create sportchef`

The *sportchef/sportchef-frontend* docker image is available on DockerHub. To run *sportchef-frontend*, you have to specify the mode (e.g. `-d` for detached), network (e.g. `sportchef`) and a port mapping to map the ports of the web server inside the container (always `80`) to a port on your machine (e.g. `8080`). The complete docker call looks like this:

`docker run -d --net sportchef -p 8080:80 sportchef/sportchef-frontend`

### Building Docker locally

To build an own image of *sportchef-frontend*, you have to give it a name (tag it, e.g. `sportchef-frontend`) and to specify the directory containing the `Dockerfile` (e.g. `.` for the current working directory). The complete docker call looks like this:

`docker build -t sportchef-frontend .`
